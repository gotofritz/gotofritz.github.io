  And now with clasp

## Using clasp

I am going to fork [PopGoesTheWza/ts-gas-project-starter](https://github.com/PopGoesTheWza/ts-gas-project-starter) and use it as starting point, hoping it's not going to become obsolete too soon. The repo is quite old, but it's not as if the Google Apps Script / Clasp space is abuzz with activity. I could updated it to the current (Q12023) version of Typescript, so it can't be that bad.

### Simplifying the clasp starter

PopGoesTheWza's repo is designed to be a centralised platform from which to publish separate GAS projects. I'd rather keep the projects separate, so first of all I will simplify that part.
