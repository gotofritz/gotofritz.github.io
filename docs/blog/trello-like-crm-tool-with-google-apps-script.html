    <h1 class="svelte-1r1v8if">A Trello-like CRM tool with Google Apps Script</h1>
    <h2 class="svelte-1r1v8if"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Keeping track of all the leads and processes when freelancing or now that I have just been laid off and am job hunting, can be a daunting task. I have built a simple tool in Google Apps Script to make the process easier<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2></section>
  <section class="post-content"><h2>Why not just use …?</h2>
<p><em>Why not just use a real CRM</em>? The issues with CRMs is that the whole problem area is quite broad, and CRM software needs to be general enough to appeal to all types of users. As a result the software is often difficult to learn and fiddly to adapt to your own particular workflow. This time investment is probably worth if you work in sales and a CRM is your main tool, but that’s not my case. I tried <a href="https://capsulecrm.com/" rel="nofollow">Capsule</a>, but I found I spent way to much time wrestling with it rather than doing what I needed to do.</p>
<p><em>Why not just use Trello</em>? Trello is great for teams using Kanban-like workflows, but I found entering and editing data far too laborious for my taste. You always need several clicks to get where you want. Also, I couln’t find ways to reorder or archive steps. Finally, I prefer to arrange processes top to bottom rather than horizontally.</p>
<h2>Google Sheets with Apps Script is a great tool for quick tools and prototypes</h2>
<h2>Tips on using Google Apps Script</h2>
<h3>Lazy loading vs trying to build a SPA</h3>
<h3>Start with the data and use abastractions</h3>
<h3>OOP for modeling problem, FP for shared functionality</h3>
<h3>Testing is not a solved problem</h3>
<h2>Coding the App</h2>
<h3>Setup and menu</h3>
<h3>Iterating without programming to reach an initial MVP</h3>
<h3>Modelling the data</h3>
<h4>Generic Atom component</h4>
<h4>Derived components: Step, Current, Meta</h4>
<h4>A Sequence of Steps</h4>
<h4>There must be a better way to provide input…</h4>
<h4>Bringing it All Together: Store</h4>
<h4>Conclusion and potential next steps</h4>
<p>I have used this app for a while and does the job quite well, with a minimum of fuss. And what is more, it was usable from day 1 - with a lot of manual data entry at the beginning, which became less and less as I automated more and more steps. Obviously it’s not as slick as a SPA put together by a team of UX and FE devs, but then it costed rather less in term of efforts. I find Google Apps Script great for knocking together quick prototypes like this.</p>
<p>I am not going to take this any further as my basic needs are met. But should I want to, it would be possible, for example to</p>
<ul><li>integrate with email to automatically generate steps from incoming messages, or generate emails from steps</li>
<li>integrate with calendar to generate appointments and set reminders</li>
<li>all of the above, to automatically generate emails with a list of available slots from my calendar.</li></ul>
<p>This would actually be quite usefaul, and who knows, I may well tackle it one of these days.</p></section>
