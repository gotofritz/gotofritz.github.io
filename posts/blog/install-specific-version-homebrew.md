## Why?

I couldn't connect to my company's repository using the latest 1.8.0 - svn failed with the message `svn: E120171: Error running context: An error occurred during SSL communication`. A quick <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" title="[new window] Search DuckDuckGo - they respect your privacy, unlike google" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a> (gosh that's a mouthful) took me to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/subversion-development/13KWf3N2myk" title="[new window] RE: svn commit: r1501049 - in /subversion/trunk/subversion: include/svn_error_codes.h libsvn_ra_serf/util_error.c - Google Groups" target="_blank">some mail group where Subversion developers bicker among themselves</a>, but no solution. So I went down to a known stabler version.

All the information here comes from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3987683/homebrew-install-specific-version-of-formula" title="[new window] Homebrew install specific version of formula? - Stack Overflow" target="_blank">this SO answer</a>.

## Uninstall the previous version

Make sure you don't have an old version of the package installed:

```bash
> brew uninstall svn
> sudo mv /usr/bin/svn /usr/bin/svn1.6
```

In the case of svn, I also needed to remove the version that comes by default with OS X, as Homebrew is not able to unlink the two.

## Find out how old versions are called

```bash
> brew search subversion
subversion
homebrew/versions/subversion16  homebrew/versions/subversion17
```

The above tells you what svn packages are available. Note that searching for `svn` instead of `subversion` returns the current version only for some reason.
So that tells me that svn 1.7.something is called `subversion17` in Homebrew world, and it can be found into `versions`

## Install old versions

```bash
> brew tap homebrew/versions

```

Before you install a version you need to enable the whole "getting old versions" thing - you do that with the `tap` command. Afterwards, it's just a matter of installing the package I found earlier.

## That's it

Job done.
