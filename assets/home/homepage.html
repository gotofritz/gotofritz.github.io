  <li>Anxious? Upset? Lonely? Bored? The screen has what you need</li>
  <li>Paw at the screen like it's a slot machine. Trigger those hits of dopamine</li>
  <li>Your digital devices are tools to be used purposefully, not slot machines to be slapped over and over for your amusement.</li>
  <li>Cut back on your aimless browsing. Way back.</li>
  <li>Don't treat digital like a cheap way to fill dead air with mindless clicking. This is like eating out of boredom.</li>
  <li>Reintroduce friction. Denature the "whip-out-the-phone” impulse.</li>
  <li>When you aren't using your phone, put it away—in a bag or on a stand on a table across the room</li>
  <li>When you aren't using your laptop, close it and put it in a drawer. Create separation.</li>
  <li>SLOW DOWN. Try thoughtfully stopping… opening your bag… removing your phone… mindfully using it… putting it back.</li>
</ul>
