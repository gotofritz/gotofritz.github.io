Hello, I'm Fritz, an experienced engineer based in Berlin. Currently I am
working as ML Engineering Manager at <a href="https://www.trawa.de/" class="inverted">Trawa</a>,
focusing on service development and ML Engineering, still pretty much hands-on with technology. I started my career as a full-stack developer. I am primarily a problem solver who uses technology, rather than a {insert tech stack} engineer.

With over two decades in the tech industry, I often share concise posts on
technical subjects. Before embarking on this tech journey, I trained as a chef, although I don't write about that topic here. Prior to that, I pursued music during my college years.

Originally from Italy, I spent the majority of my adulthood in London,
where I pursued my university education before eventually making Berlin my
home.

If you want to talk to me about work I've got a [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gotofritz/) and you can [download my resume](/fritz-stelluto_resume.pdf).
