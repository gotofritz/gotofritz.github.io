title: Batch unrar from the command line on Mac OS X
tags: []
description: I used to use the rar app from RarLab to batch unrar archives on my mac. That was almost two decades ago though, and I have no idea if the software still exists, and if it does whether it's still trustworthy. Nor do I have the time or inclination to find out.

And that's why I have archived this post.
