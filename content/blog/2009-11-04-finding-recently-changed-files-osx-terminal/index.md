## find command

To list files that were changed in the last day, sorted by size, using [bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash) in the Terminal:

```bash
❯ sudo find / -type f -mtime -1 -print0 k \
  | xargs -0 du -sk | sort -nr
```

## Command breakdown

<dl class="code-breakdown">
<dt>sudo</dt>
<dd>run in superuser mode - allows you to reach hidden system folders (if that's what you need). You'll be asked for your password</dd>

<dt>find /</dt>
<dd>use the powerful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find" title="[new window] find - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" target="_blank">find</a> command, starting from the root of the computer - in other words, search everywhere (which may not be a good idea if you are connected to a network or have a massive hard disk connected to your machine)</dd>

<dt>-type f</dt>
<dd>only look for files...</dd>

<dt>-mtime -1</dt>
<dd>...modified less than a day ago</dd>

<dt>-print0</dt>
<dd>when files are found, spit them out in a list with a NULL at the end instead of a new line - this helps with the next step</dd>

<dt>|</dt>
<dd>pass the list generated by find to the next command...</dd>

<dt>xargs -0</dt>
<dd>...which is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs" title="[new window] xargs - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" target="_blank">xargs</a>, used to take a list of results and pass them on. The -0 is telling xargs to use NULL as the separator</dd>

<dt>du -sk</dt>
<dd>use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du_(Unix)" title="[new window] du (Unix) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" target="_blank">du</a> to show how much space the files take, in kilobytes</dd>

<dt>|</dt>
<dd>pass the list generated by find to the next command...</dd>

<dt>sort -nr</dt>
<dd>...which sorts the list in reverse numerical order using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort_(Unix)" title="[new window] sort (Unix) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" target="_blank">sort</a></dd>
</dl>

## Find -exec is slow

Originally I did everything within find, using the -exec flag.

```bash
❯ sudo find / -type f -mtime -1 -exec du -sk {} \; | sort -nr
```

But it is much slower.
