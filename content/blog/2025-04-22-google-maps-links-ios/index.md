**TL;DR** After a lot of looking around, the solution is simply to delete the Google Maps app and re-install it again. That fixed everything for me.

### Sorry, what are we talking about here?

That moment when someone sends you a Google Maps link - maybe through a text, email, or when you hit "Send to Phone" from Maps on your desktop. You tap the link on your iPhone, it opens in Safari, you hit "View in the App" and... nothing. The Maps app launches, but it totally ignores the link you actually wanted to open.
