title: All Videos Youtube Playlist
date: "2025-07-06T23:55:23+02:00"

description: It used to be possible to click on a button in a YouTube channel and view all of the channels' video as a single playlist. The button is gone, but the playlist is still there.

tags: ["tips", "youtube"]

## TL;DR

1. Find the channel's ID (under "more...", "Share Channel", "Copy Channel Id")
2. The id will be in the format UCxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx. Change the C to a U, keeping the rest as is: UUxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
3. Add the edited Channel ID to the end of this url <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=>, i.e <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx>

This worked at the time of writing.
