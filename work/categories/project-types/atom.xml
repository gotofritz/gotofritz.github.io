    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many of the projects I have worked on had "widgety" elements to them, for example the <a href="/project-type/social-media/">social media</a> ones.</p>

<p>The only project  so far which consisted of nothing but widgets was for the <a href="/projects/logica-intranet-widgets/">Logica Intranet</a>. The widgets were built in <a href="/tags/jquery">JQuery</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Besides the showreels <em>de rigueur</em> in media agencies, and a pitch for Emirates for which I built the prototype, I have worked on a single <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_media">ambient media</a> project so far, basically an outdoor screen reacting to data fetched remotely as XML.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I haven't dont much work on kiosks, but as they aren't fundamentally different from other digital devices.</p>

<p>The <a href="/projects/ford-presentation-tool">Ford Presentation tool</a> was taken on a tour by Ford, and used to train sales staff. I built the backend for it.</p>

<p>The <a href="/projects/orange-kiosk">Orange Kiosk</a> was quite a larger and complex project which allowed users in Orange shops to browse the catalogue. I only played a minor role in that project.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="/projects/pebl-colours">PEBL Colours</a> project was a bit more than just a templating job - We were setting standards and procedures for the whole <a href="/clients/motorola">Motorola</a> online activities in Europe. The project involved a lot of usability testing, client meetings, and communication with different European offices.</p>

<p>For the remaining jobs, I was hired because the agencies involved needed to pass on templates to another company. They wanted an expert to make sure the work was done to a high standard and made them look good.</p>
