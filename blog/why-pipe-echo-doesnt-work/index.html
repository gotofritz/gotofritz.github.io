These terminals consisted of a keyboard and a monitor (or printer) and little else - they were basically one of those <a href=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Televideo925Terminal.jpg>fat screens</a> you see in old movies. The remote computer would happily wait around for all the characters typed by the operator at their own speed, without negative effects if the terminal was too slow in sending characters and without expecting an end. These connections, and the characters traveling on them, were called <i>streams</i>. Streams were then abstracted, so that writing to or reading from a stream is exactly the same as doing it to a file.</p><p>In modern computers the same functionality as the terminal is carried out by a small dedicated program, which is referred as either &#x201C;the shell&#x201D;, &#x201C;the command line&#x201D;, &#x201C;the CLI (command line interface)&#x201D; or, on OS X, &#x201C;Terminal&#x201D;. The CLI app uses streams to communicate with other parts of the system, like the keyboard or the network. The three default streams available on Unix terminals are STDIN to read from (the keyboard), STDOUT to write to (the shell), and STDERR to write errors to (also the shell). Standard behaviour can be easily changed, so that an app can be made to write to a file instead of the STDOUT stream, for example.</p><p>By default your CLI app connects the keyboard as STDIN and the shell window as both STDOUT and STDERR. When you type something (STDIN) it&#x2019;s passed on immediately to the app which does two things - it pushes it as it is to window (STDOUT) so that you see what you&#x2019;ve typed; and it keeps it around waiting for you to hit return. At the point it will parse what you have typed and run it as a command if it can, and print the output to the window (STDOUT); if it doesn&#x2019;t understand it, it will print an error message to the window (STDERR)</p><pre class=language-bash><code class=language-bash><span class="token comment"># Terminal taking your STDIN and copying it to STDOUT</span>

</code></pre><h3 id=program-arguments>Program arguments</h3><p>Programs can also have <i>arguments</i> - these are values that are typically typed in and passed to the program by Bash as an array. Arguments are space separated (you can use quotation marks to include a space as part of the argument).</p><pre class=language-bash><code class=language-bash><span class="token comment"># program &quot;echo&quot; called, and 3 arguments passed to it - a, b, and c</span>

<span class="token comment"># in the case of echo, the result looks exactly the same.</span>
<span class="token comment"># It may not do for other programs</span>
What&#x2019;s it going to be then, eh?
</code></pre><p>A lot of programs support both arguments and STDIN / STDOUT; but they don&#x2019;t have to. Take grep for example - a program that prints out the input if it matches a pattern. When you run it, it looks at how many arguments it was passed to decide what to do:</p><pre class=language-bash><code class=language-bash><span class="token comment"># grep called with two arguments:</span>
<span class="token comment"># export and ~/.bash_profile</span>
<span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token function">grep</span> <span class="token string">&quot;export&quot;</span> ~/.bash_profile
<span class="token comment"># it runs on the file .bash_profile in your home folder (~/)</span>
<span class="token comment"># and prints out each</span>
<span class="token comment"># line that matches the pattern</span>
<span class="token builtin class-name">export</span> <span class="token assign-left variable"><span class="token environment constant">PATH</span></span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">&quot;<span class="token environment constant">$HOME</span>/bin:<span class="token environment constant">$PATH</span>&quot;</span>
</code></pre><p>When it detects two arguments, it treats the first as a pattern, and the second as the path of a file to open and read line by line. It then prints any line in the file that include the pattern</p><p>But grep also supports STDIN:</p><pre class=language-bash><code class=language-bash><span class="token comment"># grep called with only one argument: export</span>
<span class="token comment"># Instead of connecting to a file, it waits for input on STDIN</span>
<span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token function">grep</span> <span class="token string">&quot;export&quot;</span>
<span class="token comment"># Terminal prints what you type to STDOUT, as usual</span>
I am now typing something
<span class="token comment"># still Terminal...</span>
<span class="token function">grep</span> is looking <span class="token keyword">for</span> the string <span class="token builtin class-name">export</span> - will it <span class="token function">find</span> it?
<span class="token comment"># grep has detected &quot;export&quot; in its STDIN - so it prints it to STDOUT</span>
<span class="token function">grep</span> is looking <span class="token keyword">for</span> the string <span class="token builtin class-name">export</span> - will it <span class="token function">find</span> it?
</code></pre><p>With only one argument, the programmers who created <code>grep</code> decided to treat the first argument as a pattern as before, and to wait for input from STDIN. It makes sense since with only one argument it wouldn&#x2019;t know which file to open. In the example above I start typing some random stuff and press return, and when grep finds the string matching the patter in my text it will spit out the string again.</p><h3 id=streams-piping>Streams piping</h3><p>What makes Unix so useful is that you can connect small programs together by joining the STDOUT of a program with the STDIN of another - using the pipe character, <code>|</code>, and because streams are treated like files, it will just work. But you already knew that.</p><pre class=language-bash><code class=language-bash><span class="token comment"># the STDOUT of the ps program is connected to the STDIN of grep</span>

</code></pre><h2 id=why-cant-you-pipe-a-command-to-echo>Why can&#x2019;t you pipe a command to echo?</h2><p>With all that out of the way, the explanation is quite simple - piping commands to <code>echo</code> does not work, because echo was not programmed to care about STDIN. All it&#x2019;s wired up to do is to take the <i>arguments</i> and copy them to STDOUT.</p><pre class=language-bash><code class=language-bash><span class="token comment"># ls puts the output on STDOUT, which is connected to echo&apos;s STDIN</span>
<span class="token comment"># but echo ignores STDIN, all it cares about is command line arguments</span>
<span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token function">ls</span> <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span>
</code></pre><p>So if your command ignores STDIN, what you have to do is to find a different one which does the same thing, but also reads from STDIN. In the case of echo, that substitute is <code>cat</code>, which as we saw above, does what echo does, but using STDIN as input:</p><pre class=language-bash><code class=language-bash><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token function">ls</span> ~/ <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token function">cat</span>
Applications
Desktop
<span class="token punctuation">..</span>.
</code></pre><p>But that&#x2019;s not the whole story.</p><h2 id=using-xargs-to-transform-stdin-to-arguments>Using xargs to transform STDIN to arguments</h2><p>Turns out you <i>can</i> pipe to echo, if you use <code>xargs</code>. Xargs is a command that takes STDIN and turns it into arguments for a <i>command</i> (if it finds no command it will use echo). So:</p><pre class=language-bash><code class=language-bash><span class="token comment"># xargs is basically creating the command</span>
<span class="token comment"># echo Applications Desktop Documents ...</span>
<span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token function">ls</span> ~/ <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token function">xargs</span> <span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span>
Applications Desktop Documents <span class="token punctuation">..</span>.
</code></pre><p>Notice the difference between <code>cat</code> and <code>xargs</code>. cat adds newlines - it treats each space separated word as a different input. xargs instead removes newlines - part of its purpose is to normalize blank spaces, tabs and newlines into a consistent format.</p><p>You can see that better by passing the argument -1 to ls, which prints the arguments one per line:</p><pre class=language-bash><code class=language-bash><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token function">ls</span> -1 ~/
