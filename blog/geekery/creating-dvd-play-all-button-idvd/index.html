<p>iDVD? Yeah, so passè, it doesn&#39;t even ship with Mountain Lion anymore. Still, if you are lucky enough to have an older version of OS X, here&#39;s how to add a &quot;Play All&quot; button to a DVD created with iDVD.
<!--more--></p>
<h2 id="use-imovie-not-idvd-to-create-your-movie">Use iMovie, not iDVD to create your movie</h2>
<p>The simple truth is that iDVD does not have the ability to add a &quot;Play all&quot; button to a DVD. Strange but true. And don&#39;t expect that to change any time soon - Apple is phasing out iDVD altogether (DVD are soooo 2000s, aren&#39;t they?) in fact Mountain Lion doesn&#39;t ship with it.</p>
<p>Luckily, iDVD can read iMovie&#39;s chapter markers, and when it sees them it will automagically create a &quot;Play all&quot; and a &quot;Select scene&quot; buttons. Therefore, you need to work with iMovie.</p>
<h2 id="use-mpeg-streamclip-to-get-your-videos-into-imovie">Use MPEG Streamclip to get your videos into iMovie</h2>
<p>If you have problems importing videos into iMovie, for example the movies are greyed out in the file dialog that comes up when you try <code>Import &gt; Movies...</code>, it&#39;s probably because of the wrong codec. Even if the clip is a .mov file, it may still use a codec that is not supported (.mov is a container for all sort of movie formats, rather than a format of its own).</p>
<p>The best thing to do in those cases is to use a video converter such as <a href="http://www.squared5.com/svideo/mpeg-streamclip-mac.html" title="[new window] Squared 5 - MPEG Streamclip video converter for Mac OS X" target="_blank">MPEG Streamclip</a> to convert the videos first. I like using MPEG streamclip to do some initial clean up of clips as well, as you can use the arrow keys to move one frame at the time.</p>
<h2 id="setup-imovie-to-use-the-chapter-markers">Setup iMovie to use the Chapter Markers</h2>
<p>Chapter markers are not enabled by default in iMovie, you need to go into the Preferences and tick &quot;Show Advanced Tools&quot; for some reason. Then you&#39;ll see two tiny orange boxes in the top right corner of the timeline panel. The rightmost one is the markers button. Note that it is not a button as such, it is more like a constant supply of markers that you need to drag to wherever you need it on the timeline. Normally that would be at the beginning of each of the clip.</p>
<p>Experienced users suggests you don&#39;t use a marker for the very beginning of the movie (one will be generated for you, and if you do it will confuse iDVD), nor inside a fade between clips.</p>
<h2 id="export-the-movie-for-idvd">Export the movie for iDVD</h2>
<p>After you are done with editing the video and adding markers wherever you need them, select <code>Share &gt; Media Browser...</code> and tick on &quot;large&quot;. This is supposed to give better results than just sharing to iDVD directly.</p>
<h2 id="import-the-movie-into-idvd">Import the movie into iDVD</h2>
<p>iMovie is an odd program, it doesn&#39;t have a &quot;Save&quot; menu entry, and when you share a movie it doesn&#39;t even allow you to name it or decide where to put it. So, where does iMovie store the media browser files? They go inside the project file itself, which you&#39;ll find in your Movies folder inside <code>iMovie Projects</code>. The project file in there (of type .rcproject, if you have Show File Suffix enabled in OS X) is actually a folder in disguise. To open it as a folder, right click on it, select <code>Show Package Contents</code>, and a Finder window will open there. The movie you are looking for is inside the <code>Movies</code> folder, called <code>large.m4v</code>.</p>
<p>Now you can open iDVD, set up your project (make sure the aspect ration, 4:3 or 16:9, is the same as you have set in iMovie!), and choose <code>Import &gt; Movies</code>. When the file dialog is open, go to Finder, and drag the large.m4v file onto the iDVD file dialog.</p>
<p>Now you have your DVD setup with all the buttons you need, which you can rename and move about as required.</p>
