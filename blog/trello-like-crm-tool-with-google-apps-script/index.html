The issues with CRMs is that the whole problem area is quite broad, and CRM software needs to be general enough to appeal to all types of users. As a result the software is often difficult to learn and fiddly to adapt to your own particular workflow. This time investment is probably worth if you work in sales and a CRM is your main tool, but that’s not my case. I tried <a href=https://capsulecrm.com/ >Capsule</a>, but I found I spent way to much time wrestling with it rather than doing what I needed to do.</p><p><em>Why not just use Trello</em>? Trello is great for teams using Kanban-like workflows, but I found entering and editing data far too laborious for my taste. You always need several clicks to get where you want. Also, I couln’t find ways to reorder or archive steps. Finally, I prefer to arrange processes top to bottom rather than horizontally.</p><h2 id=google-sheets-with-apps-script-is-a-great-tool-for-quick-tools-and-prototypes>Google Sheets with Apps Script is a great tool for quick tools and prototypes</h2><h2 id=tips-on-using-google-apps-script>Tips on using Google Apps Script</h2><h3 id=lazy-loading-vs-trying-to-build-a-spa>Lazy loading vs trying to build a SPA</h3><h3 id=start-with-the-data-and-use-abastractions>Start with the data and use abastractions</h3><h3 id=oop-for-modeling-problem-fp-for-shared-functionality>OOP for modeling problem, FP for shared functionality</h3><h3 id=testing-is-not-a-solved-problem>Testing is not a solved problem</h3><h2 id=coding-the-app>Coding the App</h2><h3 id=setup-and-menu>Setup and menu</h3><h3 id=iterating-without-programming-to-reach-an-initial-mvp>Iterating without programming to reach an initial MVP</h3><h3 id=modelling-the-data>Modelling the data</h3><h4 id=generic-atom-component>Generic Atom component</h4><h4 id=derived-components-step-current-meta>Derived components: Step, Current, Meta</h4><h4 id=a-sequence-of-steps>A Sequence of Steps</h4><h4 id=there-must-be-a-better-way-to-provide-input>There must be a better way to provide input…</h4><h4 id=bringing-it-all-together-store>Bringing it All Together: Store</h4><h4 id=conclusion-and-potential-next-steps>Conclusion and potential next steps</h4><p>I have used this app for a while and does the job quite well, with a minimum of fuss. And what is more, it was usable from day 1 - with a lot of manual data entry at the beginning, which became less and less as I automated more and more steps. Obviously it’s not as slick as a SPA put together by a team of UX and FE devs, but then it costed rather less in term of efforts. I find Google Apps Script great for knocking together quick prototypes like this.</p><p>I am not going to take this any further as my basic needs are met. But should I want to, it would be possible, for example to</p><ul><li>integrate with email to automatically generate steps from incoming messages, or generate emails from steps</li><li>integrate with calendar to generate appointments and set reminders</li><li>all of the above, to automatically generate emails with a list of available slots from my calendar.</li></ul><p>This would actually be quite usefaul, and who knows, I may well tackle it one of these days.</p></section></article></div><footer><div class=content><nav class=flat-nav><div itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person class="vcard group-of-links"><a href=https://github.com/gotofritz>github</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/gotofritz>twitter</a> <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/gotofritz>linkedin</a> <a href=/feed.xml>rss</a></div></nav></div><div class=content>All content by Fritz Stelluto.
