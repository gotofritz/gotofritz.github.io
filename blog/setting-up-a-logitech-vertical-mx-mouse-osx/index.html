I didn’t have issues getting used to the main buttons, but the extra thumb buttons took a while getting used to. I recommend it if you have pain issues</p><h2 id=the-software>The software</h2><p>The mouse is plug and play, but configuring those thumb buttons was more of a struggle. Logitech’s is the typical huge corporate website geared towards marketing, where finding stuff is not always intuitive. Eventually I learned that you need to install software called “Logi Options” (here is the <a href=https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/options>Logi Options download page</a>) which will ask for a few permissions (be aware, in case you start doing something else and the pop up window is hidden). After that you are good to go and you can start configuring everything.</p><h2 id=configuring-the-mouse-buttons>Configuring the mouse buttons</h2><p>Obviously I left the standard left and right buttons as they are, and the mousewheel for document scrolling. One of the thumb buttons is used to navigate through spaces; it felt a bit awkward at first (the mouse cursor doesn’t move, but the windows do) but I got used to it. I am still experimenting with the other button; the issue is that once you start customising these buttons, two are nowhere near enough… for example, I assigned the free one to the browser back button, but then I miss the forward one (and also it’s too risky, I can click it by mistake and lose work). I tried to use it to fire <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_(software)>AlfredApp</a> - not bad, but not the best as I can fire it with the other hand anyway. I assigned to the ESC key but it was pointless; after all, the whole point of VIM is <em>not</em> to use the mouse… I am now considering is to assign it to <a href=https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/ >Rocket, the emoji app</a> or the browser next tab.</p><h2 id=the-holy-grail-the-keymouse-track-127>The holy grail: the KeyMouse Track 127</h2><p>The mouse is nice, but the holy grail remains the <a href=https://www.keymouse.com/catalog/keymouse/keymouse-track-125-3d-printed-assembled>the KeyMouse Track 127</a> - no more moving the hand from (mechanical!) keyboard to mouse! Alas, a bit pricey, but still</p></section></article></div><footer><div class=content><nav class=flat-nav><div itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person class="vcard group-of-links"><a href=https://github.com/gotofritz>github</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/gotofritz>twitter</a> <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/gotofritz>linkedin</a> <a href=/feed.xml>rss</a></div></nav></div><div class=content>All content by Fritz Stelluto.
