Here&#x2019;s a list of those one letter codes and what they mean.</h2></section><section class=post-content><h2 id=svn-status-columns>SVN status columns</h2><pre class=language-bash><code class=language-bash><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> $ svn status
L index.html</code></pre><p>The output of the command is split into six columns, but that is not obvious because sometimes the columns are empty. Perhaps it would have made more sense to indicate the empty columns with dashes, the way <code>ls -l</code> does, instead of nothing. Then, for example, <code>L index.html</code> would look like <code>--L--- index.html</code>, which makes it obvious the only information we have is in the third column the one about locking. Anyway, once you know that it begins to make more sense.</p><h2 id=svn-status-first-column-a-d-m-r-c-x-i--->SVN Status first column: A, D, M, R, C, X, I, ?, !, ~</h2><p>The first column indicates that an item was added, deleted, or otherwise changed.</p><dl class=code-breakdown><dt>&#xA0;</dt><dd>No modifications.</dd><dt>A</dt><dd>Item is scheduled for Addition.</dd><dt>D</dt><dd>Item is scheduled for Deletion.</dd><dt>M</dt><dd>Item has been modified.</dd><dt>R</dt><dd>Item has been replaced in your working copy.
