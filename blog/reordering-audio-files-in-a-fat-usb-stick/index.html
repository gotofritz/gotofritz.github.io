But it is the most widely supported by consumer devices like my SONY CD/MP3 player, for example. So i have no choice.</p><p>Those devices play back songs in date creation order. That would be the creation time on the stick; i.e., the time one started transferring them to the stick. Your typical laptop copies a few of these files in parallel. So one never knows what those creation times might be. This is why they get jumbled up.</p><p>One solution could be to write a little script to change those times after copying those files. It could traverse the directory structure of the stick, and use the bash command <code>touch</code>. Or its python version. But it turns out neither works well on FAT. The python version of touch, <code>os.utime</code>, doesn&#x2019;t handle creation time. There are extensions which seem would work well, like <code>pywintypes</code>, <code>win32file</code>, <code>wintypes</code> or <code>win32-setctime</code>. But they rely on C executables that only run on Windows.</p><p>A better solution would be to write a script that copies the files one at the time. With a little pause to make sure the creation times are in order. That should work. But it would make copying files last much longer.</p><h2 id=enter-fatsort>Enter fatsort</h2><p>Luckily there is a C utility that does the job quite well. And there is a precompiled version for homebrew, the standard installer for OS X.</p><h3 id=step-1-install-it>Step 1: install it</h3><p>Your typical homebrew installation</p><pre class=language-bash><code class=language-bash><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> brew <span class="token function">install</span> fatsort

So for my USB stick, called <code>DIE_DREI</code>, it would be like in the command below. But that turns out to be too easy</p><pre class=language-bash><code class=language-bash><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> fatsort /Volumes/DIE_DREI

main: Failed to <span class="token function">sort</span> <span class="token function">file</span> system<span class="token operator">!</span></code></pre><p>Instead I needed to find out what directory the USB device is <em>mounted to</em>.
